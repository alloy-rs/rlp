## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- `Ip{,v4,v6}Addr::decode` ([#6])

[#6]: https://github.com/alloy-rs/rlp/pull/6

## [0.3.2] - 2023-07-26

### Added

- `encode` function ([#5])

### Changed

[#3]: https://github.com/alloy-rs/rlp/pull/3
[#5]: https://github.com/alloy-rs/rlp/pull/5

## [0.3.1] - 2023-07-13

### Fixed

- `length_of_length` for non 64-bit platforms ([#2])

[#2]: https://github.com/alloy-rs/rlp/pull/2

## [0.3.0] - 2023-07-12

### Added

- `arrayvec` feature with `Encodable` and `Decodable` implementations
- `smol_str` feature with `Encodable` and `Decodable` implementations
- New `decode_bytes` and `decode_str` static methods to `Header`
- `Ipv4Addr` and `Ipv6Addr` `Decodable` implementations
- A `Result` type alias for `core::result::Result<T, E = Error>`
- Re-exports for `::bytes`, `Bytes`, and `BytesMut`
- Support for generics in derive macros

### Changed

- Default `Encodable::length` implementation to use `Vec` instead of `BytesMut`
- `rlp_list_header`, `list_length`, `encode_list`, and `encode_iter` functions'
  generics to be consistent with eachother and generic over `Borrow`
- Feature-gated `encode_fixed_size` to the `arrayvec` feature
- All `Decodable` implementations always advance the buffer, even when they
  return an error. This was not documented previously. Also applies to the
  implementations derived with the procedural macros.
- Improved `Header::decode` performance
- Documented `MaxEncodedLen` and `MaxEncodedLenAssoc`
- Improved general documentation

### Deprecated

- `DecodeError` in favor of just `Error` ([alloy-rs/core#182])

### Removed
